I always strive to produce work of the highest quality. My current development style includes test

driving OO programs in C# using tools such as NUnit, Resharper, Git and ASP.NET MVC 3. I&#39;m constantly

learning and improving, and helping others to learn and improve.

Work Experience

WTG Technologies Ltd, Hammersmith (Nov 2007 - Present)

I am the evangelist for improving the quality of our coding through adoption of agile and XP practises,

believing that our clients deserve the best we can give them. I have been given the role of technical lead

on POLKA because senior management feel that I have the passion, knowledge and determination to

push through the difficult changes which need to happen if we are to improve.

Technical Lead/C# Developer - POLKA (Jul 2011 - Present)

Heavily bespoked EPiServer CMS implementation, written in C# ASP.NET 3.5. Managing two other

senior developers, as well as coordinating work between systems, test, and interdev teams whilst

liaising with the project manager and the client. I have introduced continuous integration, unit testing,

pair programming, and increased deployment automation using Powershell and MSIs. Development is

run in short iterations, with a prioritised lean-style backlog list. I&#39;m determined to increase the quality of

the code and reduce the number of defects by supporting dev team members in improving their unit

testing and OO skills. Teaching testers to write automated acceptance tests using Java and Selenium.

Currently overseeing incremental architectural refactoring to move towards something approaching

MVC using ASP.NET webforms, in order to create a more flexible system that is less coupled to any

particular framework of platform.

Sharkbite Surf Shop, Bristol (Feb 2005 - Oct 2005)

Web Developer / Shop Assistant

In My Own Time

I&#39;m constantly pushing myself to improve by reading books written by the leading lights of the industry

such as Robert Martin, Steve Freeman, and Michael Feathers on subjects ranging from OOAD to DDD to

agile principles to BDD; listening to podcasts such as Hanselminutes, and Herding Code; watching

screencasts published by Skillsmatter, and InfoQ; attending courses such as Jason Gorman&#39;s TDD/OOAD

Masterclass Series; attending meetups such as xTC, London .NET User Group; attending community

events at venues like Skillsmatter such as the Testers Gathering, and the BDD and Testers exchange;

attending Software Craftsmanship and XPDay conferences; and, of course, practicing new coding

techniques by building sites for friends including a HTML/CSS/jQuery/C# ASP.NET 3.5 layered application

for Cutler and Gross, and hacking on my own projects (currently taking the form of a teach yourself

Bridge bidding ASP.NET MVC 3 web app). I&#39;m also in the process of arranging a code retreat based on

Conway&#39;s Game of Life at Skillsmatter with BDD guru Liz Keogh, and a series of screenings of Unlce Bob&#39;s

Clean Coders videos.

I also enjoy a good party, play a bit of tennis, and am interested in becoming the next Warren Buffett.

Current responsiblities in your role
---

The responsibilities of my role are not currently formally specified
Deliver working software in collaboration with the product owner including complete technical solution
Lead small project teams, although we have quite a flat structure within the teams
Provide architectural, design, process guidance to other team members, mainly through pair programming
Expectation that I will generate process improvment and architectural change strategies to improve the code base going forward and implement those changes

Cloud experience
---

Very little cloud experience, although I'm interested and excited about the possibilities that cloud platforms provide through scriptability to improve reliability, and the management capabilities that container orchestration platforms provide, and opportunites to reduce infrastructure maintenance costs through serverless technologies.

SOLID, craftsmanship principles and experience
---

I do believe that development is a craft and as such is something requires practice to become proficient.  Personally I believe my ability to see abstractions and my test driven development practice has improved considerably over the last couple of years.  I will always continue to work to improve my proficiency with the software development craft.

SOLID is an interesting acroynm.  I believe in the underlying principles, which are to produce highly cohesive code with low coupling, but lots of people put SOLID on thier CVs without really understanding the underlying principles so I don't like to put plain SOLID on my CV.

Leading teams
---

I have led several teams from the technical point-of-view over the last ten years although I'm not particularly of the top-down command-and-control management style.  I prefer to help and influence team members at a one-to-one level whilst pairing, and through broad architectural discussions.

Agile experience
---

I much prefer to work in an agile fashion, although one problem I see with the way that companies implement 'agile' is they don't always base their future development on feedback from the development that has been completed previously.  I always split stories down in to features that deliver a deploable vertical slice of functionality, and deliver the functionality of the entire story incrementally.

Current .NET/C# experience
---

I've been building .NET/C# applications for over 10 years.  Going forward I would not like to be defined by frameworks and langauges.  I am aiming to be a polyglot programmer and also have varying degrees of experience writing F#, javaScript, ruby, python, scheme.  I try and focus on learning the fundementals of programming such object oriented design, functional programming patterns and good test driven development practice.

Current/expected salary
---

I'm currently on £70K.  I would listen to offers above £70K.

Notice period

I'm currently on a 30 day notice period
